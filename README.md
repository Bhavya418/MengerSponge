# MengerSponge
Menger Sponge is fractal curve. It is a three-dimensional generalization of the one-dimensional Cantor set and two-dimensional Sierpinski carpet.

## Construction: 
1) Begin with creating a Cube.
2) Then divide it into nine squares as in Rubik's Cube. This divides cube into 27 smaller cubes.
3) Remove the smaller cube in the center of each face and the center of the bigger cube i.e removing 7 cubes and forming a Menger Sponge(Level 1) having 20 cubes.
4) This process can be repeated to further divide and generate level-2, level-3 menger sponge upto infinity.
